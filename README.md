# 1D-Fast-Fourier-Transform-FFT-
 This project was made as part of our Computer Architecture and Assembly Language course. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an efficient algorithm to compute a sequence's Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). It transforms a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain, allowing us to analyze its frequency components so instead of directly computing the DFT which has a time complexity of O(nÂ²) the FFT reduces it to O(n log n) by breaking the problem into smaller parts and using the symmetries of complex exponentials.

# Project Overview
The FFT logic was adapted by watching various YouTube videos, which were then tried to be written in a C program, which makes it relatively easier to translate into assembly language- a non-vectorized and vectorized codes are available, which can be run on Veer Simulator on Ubuntu.
